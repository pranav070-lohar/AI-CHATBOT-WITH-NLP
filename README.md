DESCRIPTION:In this task, we built a chatbot using Python and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot was designed to understand basic user inputs and respond meaningfully using rule-based or model-based logic. We implemented this using NLTK and spaCy libraries, which provide powerful tools for text processing.

We began by designing a conversation flowâ€”either for a general assistant (greeting, weather, time, small talk) or a specialized bot (e.g., college query bot, customer service). Input from the user was captured using the input() function, tokenized and cleaned using NLTK methods (removing stopwords, converting to lowercase, etc.).

We created a basic intent classification system using keyword matching and if-else logic. For example, if the input included "hello" or "hi", the bot replied with a greeting. We later improved this by training a simple classification model using scikit-learn (optional) or matching intents via a JSON structure.

To give the chatbot more depth, we added fallback responses for unknown inputs and response variation to make it feel more natural. For example, we shuffled greetings or added a delay before printing the reply.

This project introduced us to core NLP concepts such as tokenization, lemmatization, intent recognition, and user interaction design. We learned how to handle unpredictable human language in a controlled software environment. A working chatbot is not only impressive as a demo project but also applicable in e-commerce, education, customer service, and more.
